In this virtual workshop, weâ€™ll talk broadly about types of skills, where to learn them and how to communicate them to hiring managers.

Several types of resumes can be used when applying for a new position. The type of resume you choose to create and submit will depend on the job you are applying for as well as the information you wish you convey to potential employers. A skills-based resume is a common type of resume used most frequently by those who have little experience or who are changing careers and want to highlight their skills before their work experience.

In this article, you will learn what a skills-based resume is, when it's most appropriate to use this type of resume and also see a template as well as examples of how to create a skills-based resume.

## What is a skills-based resume?

A skills-based resume, which also may be referred to as a functional resume, is a resume in which a person's skills are highlighted first and foremost as opposed to the more traditional chronological resume.

This type of resume most often lists accomplishments and skills as bold headings with an explanation as to how that skill was acquired and used in a person's previous job history. A skills-based resume is ideal for individuals with little job history such as individuals who have recently graduated from high school or college. This resume type may also be a good idea for people changing careers and who have little to no work experience in the new career field they are pursuing.

In a skills-based resume, the primary focus is on the resume summary or introduction and the skills section. In these two sections, the individual will emphasize their skills and achievements as they relate to the position they are applying for. The work experience section of a skills-based article is typically much smaller than a chronological resume and often does not include the timeframes in which the individual worked in each position. The person's contact information, education and other relevant resume sections should be included as well. The goal of a skills-based resume is to emphasize your strongest skills as they relate to the job you are applying for to increase your chances of getting an interview.

## When to use a skills-based resume

There are a few situations in which a skills-based resume would be most appropriate when applying for a new job. These situations include:

- You are changing your career or the industry in which you work and have little to no experience in the new field.
- You have gaps in your work history that exceed several months or a year.
- You have recently graduated from high school or college and have little work experience.
- You have only held short-term jobs or internships rather than extended periods of experience in one position.
- You have several previous work positions that are similar.
 -You have held the same position for several years.

If you are experiencing one or many of these situations, a skills-based resume is likely the best option. However, if you have a robust work history in several different positions in which you obtained increasing responsibility and advanced in ranks, you should consider using a chronological resume when applying to new positions.

## Frequently asked questions

### What's the difference between a skills-based resume and a functional resume?
A functional resume is another name for a skills-based resume. The format focuses on your professional skill set over your work experience, education and certifications. A functional or skills-based resume may include a summary of your qualifications, but its main focus is to highlight your abilities to compensate for a lack of work history or employment gaps.

### What are the key components of a skills-based resume?
A skills-based resume features many of the same key components as a traditional resume, though it arranges the components in a different order. The first section highlights your skills and lists relevant accomplishments under each skill heading. Subsequent sections list your employment history and education to help employers further understand your qualifications.

### Do recruiters like skills-based resumes?
Some recruiters prefer other formats besides skills-based resumes because they see these as an attempt to conceal employment gaps or a lack of experience. Skills-based resumes can also prevent employers from quickly identifying qualifications related to work history, education and certifications.

If you decide to use this format, try to be transparent about your experience to remain a trustworthy candidate. You might also clarify why you chose the format based on your career path. For instance, it might be more understandable for someone to use a skills-based resume if they're switching industries.
