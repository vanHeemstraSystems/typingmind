Why is it important to list skills on your resume?
Listing skills on your resume is important because it enables employers to understand if you're the best candidate for a job. Foremost, employers want to know if you have the baseline skills you need to perform core duties. Beyond these essential skills, your other talents and capabilities differentiate you from other candidates. You might have skills that offer an organization the opportunity to include a new or beneficial perspective.
From applicants' points of view, listing skills on a resume is part of defining their professional identity. Some skills and credentials are not subjective, such as knowing a coding language or having a certain degree. However, many of the skills you choose to share represent how you want employers to perceive you or how you want to benefit them. For instance, you may work in a primarily technical field, such as computer engineering, but if you want your next job to serve as a transition toward managerial roles, you might include skills relating to leadership and communication on your resume.
