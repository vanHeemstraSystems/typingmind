When you’re creating a resume, you have only a small space to make a big impression so a core competencies section can help you gain the attention of potential employers and make them more likely to scan the rest of your application materials.
In this article, we explain what a core competencies section is and how to create one, and we provide a list of 17 core competencies to include.

What is a core competencies section on a resume?

Core competencies, also known as your "core qualifications," is a list of your qualifications for a job. A core competencies section includes your skills, certifications, knowledge of different software products or personality traits that make you a desirable candidate. You should add your core competencies section right below your name with contact details and summary section on your resume so recruiters see it immediately. 
Adding this section to your resume provides two major benefits. The first is that it can gain the attention of any employer reviewing your resume. When employers look at a resume, they may only look at it for a few seconds, meaning that you have a short amount of space and time to gain their interest. By listing your major skills and competencies in one section, you give potential employers an overview of your abilities. 
The other reason to include a core competencies section is because of Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). An ATS is a type of software that can read resumes and analyze their content. When an ATS reviews your resume, it identifies certain keywords that the employer provided. If it finds these words somewhere on your page, it may forward your resume to a recruiter. If not, then your resume may not receive further consideration.
For example, if an employer is looking to hire a marketingmanager, they may want their ATS to search for keywords like “SEO,” “Inbound” or “Social media.” If you’re proficient in these things, you’ll want these keywords in your core competency section so that the ATS identifies them. 


How to build your core competencies section
You can follow these guidelines to create a core competencies section for your resume:

Create a list of your best qualities
A core competencies section typically contains up to 10-30 qualifications or skills, depending on your position and skill level. When creating this section, make sure you use the qualities that describe you as the best candidate for the job. Include skills you’re proficient in or certifications that show your dedication to the profession. Read the job description for any keywords that you might be able to use. Try to make each ability unique and different to demonstrate your diverse skill set. Using qualifications that are consistent with the job posting in this first section can quickly get the interest of the hiring manager and ATS.

Keep it short
In a core competencies section, you should use one or two words to describe each skill or qualification to ensure you use less space. You can use bullet points or separate each skill with a vertical line. It can be helpful to add them in a row instead of a column to use as little space as possible. For example: Skill 1 | Skill 2 | Skill 3 | Skill 4 |
Tailor it for each application
You want to tailor every aspect of your resume toward that specific job rather than sending out the same resume to every open job. Changing your core competencies section for each application shows your interest in the position and can increase your chances of passing the ATS.

Choose a layout
While the most popular place to add core competencies is right below your name and contact information, you can include them above your resume objective or summary or below it. Choose a layout that you believe makes your resume the most visually appealing. You can also use a resume template or generator as a guide in creating this section. 
You may also consider grouping your skills by category to make them easier to read and help hiring managers to find the qualifications they’re interested in quicker. For example:

Technical skills
Skill 1
Skill 2
Skill 3
Skill 4
Interpersonal skills
Skill 1
Skill 2
Skill 3
Skill 4
Certifications:
Certification 1
Certification 2

Frequently asked questions

Are resume core competencies the same as skills?
While core competencies and skills share similarities, they're not exactly the same. Skills encompass the specific abilities or proficiencies you acquire through training or experience, such as coding, writing, or project management. In contrast, core competencies can be a broad combination of knowledge, qualities and behaviors that demonstrate your overall professionalism and work ethic.

How do you choose the right core competencies to include?
You can highlight the right core competencies by reviewing the job description and identifying the key skills the employer is looking for and how your qualifications align with them. Consider your strengths and experiences and how these have helped you succeed in prior jobs. Then, select core competencies that highlight your unique value and demonstrate your suitability for the position.

Should you include technical or specialized core competencies?
In short, showcasing technical or specialized competencies on your resume can be advantageous. As long as these capabilities are relevant to the job, including them can better demonstrate your proficiency in specific tools, technology or industry-specific knowledge. In addition, technical and specialized core competencies can show employers you can excel in the role.
