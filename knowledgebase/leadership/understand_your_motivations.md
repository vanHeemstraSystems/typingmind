# UNDERSTAND YOUR MOTIVATIONS

*‘Some people spend their entire lives looking to be leaders. For others, leadership is thrust on them even when it's the last thing they're looking for’*

Think about a time you've accepted leadership responsibility. What made you agree to it and would you be willing to take on that responsibility again? Chances are you accepted the role because of a combination of reasons, some of which come from within you, pushing you to put your hand up to lead, some of which come from external factors, like the situations you face or pressure from other people, pulling you to take charge. 

When coaching experienced leaders, | ask them why they became leaders and many of their replies will resonate with you: 

Reasons pushing you 
- | like to take charge. 
- | hate passively doing nothing. 
- | don't enjoy being led by others. 
- Somebody had to do it. 
- | wanted a higher salary, so accepted the leadership opportunity. 
- As an eldest sibling, | have always heen a leader. 
- | can't stand taking orders. 
- | love helping other people. 
- | want to make changes and felt this was possible through leading. 

Reasons pulling you 
- Nobody else was leading the project, so | stepped in. 
- My senior colleagues pleaded with me to apply for the vacant management position. 
- As a woman, | was encouraged to take on the role as part of a gender diversity drive. 
- | was under a lot of peer pressure. 
- | had no choice as | was the only Suitable person. 
- | wanted to say ‘no’ but was afraid to turn down the promotion. 

To be a successful leader, you have to understand why you've taken on leadership responsibilities. You may not like the reasons, it might have been al! pull and no push, but by properly understanding your motivations, you can more successfully decide how you'll take on and excel in a leadership role. 

## PUT IT INTO ACTION

Are you a natural leader or follower? Either way, you may need to adjust your natura! instincts to get the best out of yourself. 

## Control the obsessive need to lead 
The things that push you to want to lead are your internal drivers made up of your personality, ego, motivations and inner needs. If you always feel compelled to take the lead, it can indicate that you re an ambitious person who will always step up when the opportunity arises, but it's not always a good thing. This impuise can lead you to take on leadership responsibilities before you re ready or capable. You risk failing simply because you weren't willing to wait until you had more experience.

## Overcome the reluctance to lead 
You may face the opposite problem and have no wish to lead and no inclination to stand out. That's fine as lonq as you manage to avoid leadership roles, but a big problem when you have responsibility thrust on you. Its never a good idea to wait until you ve been pushed into the swimming pool before learning to swim, so take the opportunity to read up on topics that you re not so comfortable with in advance, and make a mental decision to be more assertive in overcoming your worries. 

## Don’t be bullied into accepting roles 
Even the best leaders say no to new tasks and responsibilities now and again. For sure, there can be persuasive pull factors involved, but never be afraid to upset other people who are pushing you. Decide whether you feel ready ana whether you want the additional responsibilities and accompanying recognition before accepting anything.
